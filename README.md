Around 2012 I read an article in the newspaper that a chinese
research student had made a way to read the human heartbeat
with a videocamera at arbitrary distance.  I thought that was
cool, and wanted to make the algorithm into a mobile phone
app.  The research paper he wrote was cheap.

Unfortunately, I was politically targeted and brainwashed
around then, and for some reason the experiences, which
included torture, focused among a handful of other things
on preventing me from developing the app.

I've kept this app idea as kind of a token for many years now,
a way to see whether I am free to work on software projects
of my own choosing.

I am not.  Still, I have valued this app for so long, that
it is nice to make progress on it, anyway.

This repository is a place to hold my work towards that.

By understanding how ICA works, we can optimize it for
a low-end device.  We could make an app that lets the user
extract visual signals from almost anything, but notably
the human heartbeat.
